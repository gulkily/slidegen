I notice that you haven't specified what topic the next slide should cover. Looking at the progression of the previous slides, it seems they follow a logical sequence from:

1. Deep Learning fundamentals
2. Artificial neurons
3. Feedforward Neural Networks
4. Backpropagation and Gradient Descent
5. CNNs
6. RNNs
7-10. Course structure and technical requirements

A natural next topic might be "Transformers and Attention Mechanisms" as it's a crucial modern architecture after CNNs and RNNs. Here's the proposed slide content:

<div class="slide-content">
    <h2>Transformers and Attention Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>Transformer architectures represent a breakthrough in deep learning, particularly for natural language processing tasks, through their innovative use of attention mechanisms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-attention allows models to weigh the importance of different parts of input sequences</li>
        <li>Parallel processing capabilities overcome the sequential limitations of RNNs</li>
        <li>Key components include:
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-head attention</li>
                <li>Positional encoding</li>
                <li>Feed-forward networks</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Powers modern language models like GPT, BERT, and their derivatives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This architecture has become the foundation for most state-of-the-art AI language models and has found applications beyond NLP in computer vision and multimodal tasks.</p>
