1. Deep Learning is a machine learning approach that uses multi-layered neural networks to automatically extract features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering, and finds applications in various fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
2. Artificial neurons, inspired by biological brain cells, are the fundamental components of neural networks that process inputs through weights, biases, and activation functions (like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) to learn complex patterns in data.
3. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) are basic artificial neural networks that process information in one direction through interconnected layers (input, hidden, and output), characterized by unidirectional flow without feedback loops, and are commonly used for tasks like pattern recognition, classification, and regression analysis.
4. Backpropagation and Gradient Descent work together in neural network training, where backpropagation calculates how each network parameter affects the error, while gradient descent uses this information to adjust these parameters to minimize prediction errors through iterative updates.
5. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized deep learning architectures that process grid-like data, especially images, through a combination of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, offering efficient processing and automatic feature extraction capabilities that make them particularly effective for computer vision tasks.
6. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are deep learning models that process sequential data using internal memory states and feedback loops, enabling them to handle tasks like natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction through various architectures including LSTM and GRU.
